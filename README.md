# tclib

This lib is my own one for making projects. I don't mean that it's an alternative to std but it'd be great to make sth cool for myself (maybe it can be useful for someone).
---
Initially this lib was developed for C++ but recently I started making it also for C.
The latest version has such a list of changes:
+ Generally changed the structure of the library
+ Added a demo module "tcarr" for C, which allows you to work with arrays
+ Changed a LICENSE file (Decided to try BSD license)
