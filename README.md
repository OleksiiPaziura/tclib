# tclib

This lib is my own one for making projects. I don't mean that it's an alternative to std but it'd be great to make sth cool for myself (maybe it can be useful for someone).

# Modules
There are just two modules at the moment and each of them is located in the tc namespace (means TophCore lib). There is hierarchy of the library:
+ Algorithms
